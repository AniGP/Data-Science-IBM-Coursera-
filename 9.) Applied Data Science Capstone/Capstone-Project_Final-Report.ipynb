    "Our data is now ready to be fed into machine learning models.\n",
    "We will use the following models:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN will help us predict the severity code of an outcome by finding the most similar to data point within k distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree model gives us a layout of all possible outcomes so we can fully analyze the concequences of a decision. It context, the decision tree observes all possible outcomes of different weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Because our dataset only provides us with two severity code outcomes, our model will only predict one of those two classes. This makes our data binary, which is perfect to use with logistic regression."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "In the beginning of this notebook, we had categorical data that was of type 'object'. This is not a data type that we could have fed through an algoritim, so label encoding was used to created new classes that were of type int8; a numerical data type.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "After solving that issue we were presented with another - imbalanced data. As mentioned earlier, class 1 was nearly three times larger than class 2. The solution to this was downsampling the majority class with sklearn's resample tool. We downsampled to match the minority class exactly with 58188 values each.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we analyzed and cleaned the data, it was then fed through three ML models; K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression. Although the first two are ideal for this project, logistic regression made most sense because of its binary nature.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation metrics used to test the accuracy of our models were jaccard index, f-1 score and logloss for logistic regression. Choosing different k, max depth and hyparameter C values helped to improve our accuracy to be the best possible."
